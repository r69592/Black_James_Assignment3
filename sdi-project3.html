<p>My friend Caleb has an amazing singing voice.
He has been writing and singing the majority of his life, Caleb is trying to get famous and be heard.
Caleb, aside from his talent, works hard at an unfavorable job.
Though Caleb dislikes his job, he needs all the income he can get towards making his dream a reality. 

Recording just one song is $350.00.
He has only been able to record two songs due to his budget of $1000.00.
He often questions the importance of many things that interfere with his dream.
Should I arrive to work late today to finish writing this song? I have just one more verse to write.
He goes to work on time everyday any way. He knows the importance of his job. Caleb will reach his dream one day, of this I'm sure.</p>
